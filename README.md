# REACT PORTFOLIO (HOMEWORK USE)

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

```md
This will mainly focus on the homework repo but I will add another link for the portfolio that I will be actually using as part of searching for my new career, this is due to the homework assignment asked for specific criteria 

```
## Technlogies used to built the Portfolio

These are the technologies that I used to develop the website

```
npx create-react-app ReactHomework20
```

```
npm i react-icons swiper 
```

- **React** - <ins>React</ins> is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. Made by Facebook due to the different <em>components/sections</em> that the company uses on their own platform.

- **React-icon** - <ins>React-icons</ins> is a small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) to your React apps. It delivers the icons to your app as components so they're easier to work with, and it lets you style them so they're consistent with the overall style of your app.

- **Swiper** - Swiper is the most modern free mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. I used this for showcasing my projects

I will show snippets of both portfolio apps, both had a similar scheme
